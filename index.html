                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p> After my first set of lash extensions, I became very intrigued about how this little addition could
                    make such a big difference. The lashes were heavy and black, but once I had experienced them, I
                    could see the potential of a more natural set so I could relax during the day and not look quite so
                    glamorous all the time. I found some brown lashes online along with a lash extension training
                    course in Plymouth and have been enjoying revealing hidden beauty since qualifying in 2017. The
                    industry has grown a lot in those six years, and so have the range, colour and quality of lashes.
                    Having a degree in fine art and loving portraiture helps. <br /><br />
                    I sometimes hear “lash extensions damage natural lashes”. I have had ongoing clients for years
                    who have enjoyed the freedom they give. With the right weight of extended lash to natural lash,
                    they should not cause any damage. Extensions can actually allow natural lashes to grow more fully
                    because there is no abrasion from the daily mascara routine.<br /><br />

                    For ongoing clients, I sometimes suggest a rest from extensions and the application of a lash serum
                    or we agree to lighter lashes for a while, especially after a big set for a special occasion.
                    Eyelash health is important to me. I take photos for comparison and show these to clients. Many
                    things
                    affect eyelash growth, the seasons, hormones, general poor health, happiness and sunny holidays!</p>
            </section>

            <section id="lashes">
                <h2><b><strong>Eye Lash Extensions <br> Classic / Volume / Hybrid</strong></b></h2>

                <!-- <img src="pageImages/colouredLashClearBack.png" alt="lashes"> -->

                <p id="lashText">

                    All lash extensions are available in varying thicknesses, lengths, curls and colours and so they
                    can be selected to fit a real lash. Natural lashes always vary in maturity and it takes a variety of
                    lash
                    lengths and weights of extension to create a full set. I have a huge range to hopefully suit
                    everyone.<br /><br />
                    Classic lash extension is one manufactured lash adhered to one growing lash and suits someone
                    with already full lashes. They can look the most natural and are the quickest and simplest to
                    apply.<br /><br />

                    Lash extensions can also be very fine and formed into fans to give a volume effect. This can create
                    a softer look than classic lashes or be very dramatic.<br /><br />

                    A combination of single lashes and fans is known as hybrid. It’s very popular and suits most people
                    giving the best of both options, especially for those of us with finer lashes.<br /><br />

                    Top-ups are needed usually within two to three weeks because we shed our natural lashes daily and
                    the extensions fall out with the natural lash.<br /><br />

                    Sometimes if someone sleeps more on one side than another their lashes may fall out unevenly. In
                    this case, I would recommend a 3D sleep mask.<br /><br /><br />

                    "Extensions are very effective when lashes are going grey or thinning in men and women.<br />
                    They can be an amazing confidence boost at any age".

                <h2><b><strong>Eyebrows & Lash lift</strong></b></h2>
                <!-- <img src="pageImages/eyeBrows.png" alt="eyeborws"> -->
                <p id="browsText">I have more recently embarked on lash lift and brow lamination training to offer
                    clients a whole
                    treatment in one visit. This includes waxing, threading and dyeing of lashes and brows. I use a
                    warm natural wax which is gentle and doesn’t remove any skin and I have plant dyes.
                    A lash lift applied to already beautiful lashes that just need an extra curl to show them off can be
                    all that’s needed.
                    Both laminated eyebrows and lash lift involve perming & neutralising solutions just like normal
                    hair but in formulas and timings designed for these areas.</p>

            <section id="price-list">
                <h2>Price List</h2>
                <p id="priceText">The average cost of lash extensions at Bliss is £45.00 for an hour and a half of full
                    attention, increasing
                    to £60 with volume. <br />
                    I’m happy to be fairly flexible with my price for infills, as these can be weekly for some clients
                    who
                    always want their lashes in top form or who prefer shorter appointments. Most infills after two/
                    three weeks will cost £30. Some clients can last four weeks and still only need a half-set top-up! I
                    will try to make your lashes last, and always give informed aftercare advice so you can get the most
                    out of them.<br /><br />
                    I hope you have found this explanatory enough, but if you require any more information prior to
                    booking a patch test please ask. I can advise better when I see your lashes and brows.<br /><br />
                    Eyelash extension £45-£60+<br />
                    Infills: average £28/£35<br />
                    Lash lift £25<br />
                    Brow lamination £25<br />
                    Waxing and tinting are £12 unless they are a combined treatment in which case they are £6 each.

                <p>"I’ve been having my natural lashes for a couple of years now. Carrie is always mindful about the
                    condition of my own lashes each time I have my appointment and makes recommendations for the
                    style/length of lashes to apply based on this. I’m always delighted with the results. I find the
                    session very relaxing and Carrie is so easy to talk to. She always manages to fit me in when I need
                    lashes and is flexible with appointments. I’ve recently started having my brows waxed too. Carrie
                    uses the ‘finger peeling’ wax which is so much more precise and gentle than strips. I’d highly
                    recommend Carrie- she is a woman of many talents!" </p>
